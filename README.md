# About Me

**Study:**  
I am Mohamed Amine Zouay, an electronics and instrumentation student with a strong focus on MLOps and AI. I have been studying machine learning workflows, model deployment, continuous integration, and automation to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

**Projects:**  
- Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline to deploy and monitor models using Docker and MLflow.  
- Built an automation system integrating AI models for predictive maintenance in industrial equipment.  
- Implemented CI/CD workflows for machine learning projects to ensure smooth and reliable updates.

I’m passionate about combining electronics, AI, and MLOps to build scalable and impactful systems. Let’s connect to collaborate on innovative solutions!
